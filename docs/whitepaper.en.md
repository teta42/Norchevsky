## 1. Introduction

**Norchevsky** is an innovative neural game engine designed for running long and logical tabletop role-playing games using artificial intelligence and software abstractions. The project aims to create a flexible and scalable system capable of providing deep contextual understanding of the world, characters, time and space.

## 2. Project Goals

- Provide a tool for creating complex interactive narratives while maintaining the integrity of the plot.
- Combine the capabilities of AI and traditional programming to improve the manageability and predictability of scenarios.
- Develop a modular architecture that allows for easy expansion of functionality.
- Create a universal platform applicable to both RPGs and visual novels and other genres.

## 3. System Architecture

Norchevsky's architecture is based on a combination of several key components:

### 3.1 Database

- It is a hierarchy of folders and Markdown files.
- Each file contains structured information about the entities of the world: characters, items, events, tasks, etc.
- The use of internal links (hyperlinks) provides semantic links between objects.
- Flexibility and extensibility are supported: the database structure can be dynamically modified by AI agents that create or change folders and files during the game.

### 3.2 Abstractions

- Abstractions are software objects that generalize the entities of the database.
- Example: the "Sword" object aggregates all data related to a specific item and provides an interface for interaction (e.g. adding to inventory, applying effects, describing lore).
- Allows to isolate business logic and simplify software management of world elements.

### 3.3 Multi-agent system

- The system includes several specialized AI agents with separate roles.
- The narrative agent is responsible for generating events, dialogues and plot development.
- The memory agent processes and updates the context, structures new data, monitors the coherence of the story.
- The planning agent predicts and works out future events, supports the logic of the world.
- Inter-agent interaction allows to optimize work and minimize errors.

### 3.4 Map and time system

- The map is implemented as a grid structure with several scales (e.g. city, district, room).
- Provides unified positioning of characters and objects.
- The concept of game time is introduced, which takes into account the duration of movements, events and actions.
- Allows to exclude illogical movements and calculate real time costs.

### 3.5 Item and Creature States

- The system keeps track of the state of game entities (hunger, fatigue, inventory status, health, etc.).
- Allows you to apply system effects and debuffs based on current parameters.
- Automates the management of game resources and character conditions.

### 3.6 Task and Background Process System

- Allows AI to delegate computationally heavy or lengthy operations to the background.
- For example, working out complex scenarios, generating chains of events, predicting reactions.
- Increases system responsiveness and content generation quality.

### 3.7 Motivational System and "Soft Walls"

- Instead of hard restrictions, a system of psychological motivations for characters is used.
- Serves to manage the player's freedom of action through internal motives, advice, and emotional barriers.
- Allows you to maintain game flexibility and narrative logic without artificial prohibitions.

## 4. Prompt Engineering and AI Integration

- An important element is structured prompt engineering ‚Äî development and management of query sets that allow you to control the quality and consistency of AI outputs.
- Using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) allows you to efficiently extract relevant information from the database and transfer it to AI for informed answers.
- Multi-agent architecture allows you to distribute different types of tasks between specialized AI modules.

## 5. Application and Prospects

- Norchevsky is suitable for creating interactive RPGs with a deep plot.
- Can be adapted for visual novels, simulators and educational projects.
- The system is designed for long-term development and scaling, including the ability to connect new AI models and expand functionality.

## 6. Conclusion

The Norchevsky project aims to become a next-generation platform for AI-driven interactive narratives, combining software abstractions and intelligent agents to create realistic, large-scale and flexible game worlds.
