## 1. Mission and purpose of the project

The **Norchevsky** project is created with the goal of developing a universal neural engine for building interactive, logical and long-term game worlds using artificial intelligence. Its mission is to provide developers and authors with a next-generation tool for modeling complex narrative systems, where AI not only serves the script, but actively participates in its logic, structure and development.

The idea of the project is to combine the strengths of AI, program logic and game structure to create stable and explainable stories in which the player's freedom is combined with the cause-and-effect order of the world.

---

## 2. Expected results

- Creation of a scalable engine with support for abstract game structures and semantic memory.
- Providing the ability to model a world with deep connectivity of events, objects and decisions.
- Improving the quality of interactive plots by delegating the generation of secondary events and consequences to AI agents.
- Forming an open but licensed core of the system, suitable for both single-player development and studios.

---

## 3. Problems to solve

- **AI inconsistency**: eliminating illogical transitions and plot royals by introducing memory, causality, and premise checking mechanisms.
- **Limitations of interactive RPGs**: expanding the possibilities of interaction with the world due to a dynamically generated knowledge base and software abstractions.
- **Lack of software controllability in AI games**: creating software interfaces that allow flexible interaction with world entities.
- **Difficulty coordinating large stories**: introducing a multi-agent architecture to distribute tasks between AI and system logic.

## 4. Long-term vision

In the long term, **Norchevsky** is seen as:

- **A new type of game engine** ‚Äî combining generative intelligence and predictability of software systems.
- **Author platform** ‚Äî a tool for scriptwriters, masters, and game designers that allows them to focus on the world without losing control.
- **Research environment** ‚Äî a basis for studying AI behavior in open game environments and interactions with human players.
- **Commercially adaptable product** ‚Äî a project with the possibility of licensing, expansion, and professional use.

## 5. Key development areas

- **Formalization of data structure**: standardization of the representation of entities, events, and relationships in the Markdown database.
- **Agent development**: development of specialized AI agents for memory, narrative, logic, generation, and forecasting.
- **Map and Time Optimization**: Introduction of a spatio-temporal framework for logical positioning and time constraints.

---

## 6. Unique Project Features

- **Semantically Managed Database**: Organization of the world through text files with a flexible system of links and conceptual connections.
- **Hybridity of AI and Code**: Instead of full generation of all content by AI, there is a separation of duties, where AI works within specified boundaries and rules.
- **Motivational Logic Instead of Strict Prohibitions**: Application of psychological limitations and plot conditioning, rather than mechanical "walls".
- **Scalable Map with Time Frames**: Control over movement and time allows for a realistic sense of space.
- **Background Task Support**: AI can generate events and develop the plot outside the main branch, ensuring constant saturation of the world.

Norchevsky does not seek to replace human skill - it was created to expand it. This is not a tool for automating creativity, but for increasing its scalability and controllability in a digital interactive environment.

And also remember that at the time of the start of development _(2025-08-04)_ Norchevsky is being developed by one person, so it will take a lot of time to complete everything.
