I came up with a battle module for Norchevsky

<!-- truncate -->

:::note Key Features?
- Positioning in space and time of all objects 
_(characters, items, covers, etc.)_
- Tracking and aggregation of all objects' state
- Convenient access to tracking data
- Conducting the battle itself

## Battle Management Ideas

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="round dance" label="Round Dance" default>
    There is one main _agent_ that programmatically calculates all possible decisions and, based on this data and orders from above, determines the behavior of battle participants.
    :::info Pros
    Good dynamics due to comprehensive non-player combat design
    :::

    :::danger Cons
    - Hyper-factorial complexity
    - Too many calculations required
    - Risk of the round dance agent being overwhelmed by data
    :::
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="swarm" label="Swarm">
    Each battle participant has their own agent (and AI), their own memory, and is fully autonomous. The battle is conducted in turn-based mode.
    :::info Pros
    - Easier to implement due to turn-based system and local processing
    - Can create more scenarios (e.g., when an agent fails to notice something)
    :::

    :::warning Cons
    Slightly reduced dynamics, but since AI processes quickly, turns will be returned to the player promptly.
    :::
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="hybrid" label="Hybrid">
    A blend of both previous approaches, attempting to combine their strengths.
    
    Differs from the swarm by having a central coordinator that reminds agents of common goals, tactics, and other pre-agreed battle parameters.
  </TabItem>
