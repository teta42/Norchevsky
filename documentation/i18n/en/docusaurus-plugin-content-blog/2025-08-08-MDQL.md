MDQL — MarkDown Query Language

<!-- truncate -->

If earlier to get context from a file it was necessary to either look at pre-created tl;dr, or ask a separate agent to compress the context from the file,

now there is a separate query language for querying or changing data in MD files — **MDQL**.

:::info MDQL
This is a language inherited from GraphQL, allowing agents to get and change only the necessary data from Markdown files. This ensures programmatic tl;dr, as well as transparency and control over queries.

MDQL optimizes work with a large number of documents, reducing data redundancy and speeding up query processing.

Both reading and writing are supported, which allows not only to retrieve information, but also to automatically update or structure the content.

__Example__ of a simple MDQL query:

```GraphQL
{
  file(path: "characters/hero.md") {
    frontmatter {
      name
      role
    }
    content(filter: "skills") {
      title
      description
    }
  }
}
````

This query will extract only the name, role, and description of skills from the hero file.

:::caution This is just an example
MDQL is just an idea for now, the implementation will most likely look completely different
