title: ðŸŒ€ The Query Language Has Radically Changed

Recently, my [DSL](/blog/about-my-dsl) has undergone several changes: it was renamed, its syntax was modified, and eventually it disappeared entirely.

<!-- truncate -->

:::info ðŸ”„ Name Change
[After the latest updates](/blog/yql), the DSL was renamed to:

**NorQL** - *Norchevsky Query Language*

This ensures the name is associated with the project rather than just a file format.
:::

But yesterday, the DSL was completely retired, unable to compete with the new concept of agent-database interaction.

## ðŸ“š NFL - Norchevsky's Functional Library
Instead of a full DSL, there will now be a library of functions that agents can call.

These functions are similar to tools from the Python LangChain library.

The functions are divided into 3 categories:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="1" label="Low-Level" default>
    Provide direct access to database files.
    :::note For example
    - Retrieving subsections
    - Reading section text
    - Updating/adding text or sections
    :::
    Direct work with YAML files.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="2" label="High-Level">
    Work with multiple YAML files:
    - Data filtering
    - Querying specific data (e.g., schemas of multiple files)
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="3" label="ðŸš€ Hyper-Functions">
    Combine the functionality of multiple high-level functions.
    :::note Advantage
    Instead of creating multiple functions with unique names and arguments, a single function was developed that can perform their tasks when provided with appropriate arguments.
    :::
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
