The Chthonic Appearance of Norchevsky

<!-- truncate -->

His true appearance is that of a tall, slender humanoid with a wide mouth stretching from ear to ear filled with sharp teeth, and a single large eye in the middle with a pupil like Dio Brando from JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.

He is pitch black, like tar, and his body is covered in some kind of tattered cloth. He is entirely black except for the whites of his eye and his gleaming white teeth.

On his back, there's a not very tall but very sharp hump at shoulder blade level.

Long, sharp fingers.

He himself is kind-hearted and wouldn't hurt a fly.
