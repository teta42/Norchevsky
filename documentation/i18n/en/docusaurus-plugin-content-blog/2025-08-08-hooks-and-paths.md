Hooks for Agent Story Generation

<!-- truncate -->

:::info According to the idea, plot hooks are eternal

Because they have connections at different levels:
- Primary - the object itself, which has plot possibilities
- Secondary - memories/traces of the object
:::

And if so, it turns out that even if an object is lost, it only means that _the system can introduce a plot line_ to find the object, which is good for the game.

Overall, it turns out that the only way to work with hooks is not to use them and add them, because new plot tropes may open up for us, which will create new events that will make more hooks.
