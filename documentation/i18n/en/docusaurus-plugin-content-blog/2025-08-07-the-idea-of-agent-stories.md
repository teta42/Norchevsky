How Agents Invent the Future

<!-- truncate -->

According to the idea, worker agents when creating the future must take into account the _present_ and the _past_.

This means they must rely on **their** previous iterations.  
These iterations store not only **what** they did (for example, came up with an event and a way to achieve it),  
but also **what prerequisites** they left for future steps.

Yes, during generation they can also consider the **context of the whole world**.  
Therefore, the formula for generating the future looks something like this:

```text
past + present + previous iterations + world context = future events
```

**World context** is everything that agents can additionally introduce into the game while preserving the lore and style,
so that something new appears in the story, not just the same thing in a loop.
