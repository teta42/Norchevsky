## Simply Speaking ðŸ¤”
I started thinking about which components to add to the MVP, and thought about episodic memory. Seems like nothing heavy:
- Integrate a BYaM agent response verification pipeline for reminders
- Create a small database for storing episodes
- And the md file scheme doesn't seem heavy

Then a bunch of fundamental questions poured in: ðŸ¤¯
- What is an episode?
- How does it start and end?
- How will the [hooks system](/hooks-and-paths) work?
- And so on.
