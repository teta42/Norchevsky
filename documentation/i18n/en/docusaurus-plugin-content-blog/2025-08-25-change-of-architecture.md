**I made a major update!** The architecture of my system **changed** 🚀 from monolithic synchronous to microservice parallel.

<!-- truncate -->
## Pros of the changes ✅

1) **The architecture became clearer**: there is no one big "black box". 👏
2) **The system became faster**: processing time decreased from ~60 seconds to ~20 seconds. ⚡
3) **The quality of responses remained the same** - the amount of tasks performed remained the same. 🎯

## Cons of the changes ⚠️

**The cost of development increased** due to the complexity of the distributed system. 💸

**Overall, the switch was worth it** 🌟 - the over 60% performance improvement is worth the extra development effort.
