## About the Project

**Norchevsky** is a Neuro Game Engine:
- Neuro - because it's AI-powered
- Game - because it's designed for gaming
- Engine - because it allows creating various text-based games: D&D, RPG, visual novels, etc.

Norchevsky aims to create the most interactive and immersive gaming experience through AI flexibility and the absence of "invisible walls".

## Why This Project Exists

This project serves two key purposes:
- Solo play of tabletop role-playing games (RPG)
- Assistance in running D&D campaigns and other story systems

:::info What Makes Norchevsky Special?
It can [generate the future](/blog/the-idea-of-agent-stories) -  
meaning it doesn't just create random events but **logically and consistently develops the story**,  
considering the world's past and current context.
:::

Simply put, Norchevsky can be a second game master,  
and even a co-author in how the story unfolds.

:::tip Who Will Find It Especially Useful
If you play solo and want the story to develop naturally -  
or if you're a game master with limited planning time -  
Norchevsky can handle part of the creative and logical work.
:::

It doesn't just "suggest ideas" but does so considering the world context,  
meaning, and what has already happened in the game.  
This makes the story **not random** but a _continuation of something meaningful_.

:::note
Norchevsky CANNOT create something truly unique (it's just AI after all), but it should be capable of maintaining a story started by **you** at a decent level.
:::

## What This Project Should Become

Norchevsky is not just a _tool_, it's a potential **co-author of your story**.  
It should be able to take your idea and turn it into a living, evolving world:  
with unique characters, locations, events, and story campaigns.

:::info Project Potential
Minimum - be your assistant in narrative building.  
Maximum - develop entire worlds, starting from your concept and moving forward independently as an author-agent.
:::

But there's an important rule:

:::tip Everything Starts With You
Norchevsky doesn't read minds.  
You are the **beginning of the story**.  
You must set the direction: Provide references, constraints, preferred development vectors, key features, and world ideas.
:::

Want steampunk in a swamp?  
Want cosmic realism with elements of a nomadic magic clan?  
Please. But describe it.

:::caution Without a Foothold - No Movement
Without an initial idea, constraints or preferences - even the smartest system won't create a meaningful story.  
This is not a magic wand. It's a creative partner.
:::

Norchevsky will develop your story -  
but only if you let it enter **your game**, not just generate a set of templates.

This is the project's strength:  
**customizable, intelligent, and collaborative approach to narrative**,  
where you are the chief architect, and Norchevsky is your best assistant.

## Project Architecture

:::tip Yes, the diagram is approximate
Unfortunately, it will be impossible to describe everything in one diagram, so I will create a bunch of smaller diagrams.

## Background

:::info It All Started With a Simple Question:
> What if we give AI long-term working memory?
> So it doesn't forget what's happening and can support long games.
:::

The project idea came from personal frustration.  
About a year ago, I first tried using AI as a dungeon master for D&D - and quickly realized that after just a few messages between Chekhov's gun and complete oblivion, the story falls apart. Sequence is lost.  
And this became not just a reason for disappointment, but real fuel for the future project.

:::tip The Second Spark
Just a week or two before creating this repository, I started playing the visual novel **"Endless Summer"**.  
The story was interesting, but I quickly realized that the story was *absolutely inflexible*. Everything is strictly scripted.  
You can't turn aside, you can't ask a question, you can't just run out the gate and escape, you can't truly influence what's happening.

And that's when that spark ignited.  
It set fire to all the accumulated fuel and flesh of the project, and from this flame came a clear goal.
:::

:::caution The Author Understands:
That a visual novel is primarily a story, not an interactive history.
:::

**This project is an attempt to do things differently.**  
To create a tool where AI is not just a narrator, but your co-author.  
It remembers. It knows how to develop ideas. It is part of the world you create together.

## About Me

:::info Briefly
I am a human. And that's already good.
:::

A bit more: I'm a self-taught programmer-engineer.  
My imagination is as mobile as mercury, and my ambitions are at the level of projects that others wouldn't tackle without a decade of experience.  
I take this experience **from the projects themselves**:  
knowing nothing, I dive into the depths - and learn on the go. _Sometimes scary_, though who am I kidding - it's always unclear.
