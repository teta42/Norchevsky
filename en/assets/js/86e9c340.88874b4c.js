previous iterations.  \\nThese iterations store not only **what** they did (for example, came up with an event and a way to achieve it),  \\nbut also **what prerequisites** they left for future steps.\\n\\nYes, during generation they can also consider the **context of the whole world**.  \\nTherefore, the formula for generating the future looks something like this:\\n\\n```text\\npast + present + previous iterations + world context = future events\\n```\\n\\n**World context** is everything that agents can additionally introduce into the game while preserving the lore and style,\\nso
